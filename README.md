# C++ Visual Sorter
Visual representation of different sorting algorithms using c++ and OpenGL

This program visualizes the Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, and Quick Sort sorting algorithms using c++ and OpenGL. The list used for sorting has a range of 100 to 500 and is randomized. The user is given the option to choose the size of the list and the sorting algorithm.

# How to Run
You can run this program by downloading and running the exe in release.

If you wish to compile the source code yourself instead, you can do that too. However, you will need to link GLFW 3 when compiling.
